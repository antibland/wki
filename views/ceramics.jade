          | Solid Zirconia is indicated for crowns, bridges, veneers, inlays and onlays, screw-retained implant crowns and full-arch implant prostheses. It is an esthetic alternative to PFM metal occlusal/lingual or full-cast restorations and ideal for restorations requiring extra durability such as crowns under partials or screw-retained implant crowns. The chip-proof durability of BruxZir restorations also makes them ideal for bruxers who have broken natural teeth or previous PFM restorations. BruxZir restorations are also ideal for patients lacking the preparation space for a PFM.
